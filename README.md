# Image Classification - CIFAR-10
In this project, I classified images from the [CIFAR-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) using a convolutional neural network (CNN). 

The dataset consists of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects.

The project involved the following steps:

* Preprocessing of the images.
* Training a CNN on all the samples.
* Normalizing the images and one-hot encoding the labels. 
* Building convolutional, max pooling, dropout, and fully connected layers. 
* Testing the predictions on sample images.

The project is implemented in this [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/kkufieta/image-classification-cifar10/blob/master/dlnd_image_classification.ipynb).
